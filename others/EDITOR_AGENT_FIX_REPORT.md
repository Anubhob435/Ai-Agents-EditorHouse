## Editor Agent Fix Summary
**Date**: January 16, 2025  
**Issue**: Editor agent including meta-commentary in chapter content  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem Description
The `chapter_editor_agent` was including explanatory text at the beginning and end of edited chapters:
- **Start**: "Okay, here's an edited version of your chapter, focusing on improving grammar..."
- **End**: "**Key Changes and Rationale:** [detailed explanation]... I hope these edits are helpful!"

### Root Cause
The prompt in `chapter_editor_agent` didn't explicitly instruct the AI to return only the edited content without explanatory text or rationale.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Fixed Editor Agent Prompt ✅
**File**: `Ai-book-adk/sub_agents/editor_agent/tools.py`
**Change**: Added explicit instruction to return only clean content:
```python
# Added to prompt:
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the edited chapter content. Do not include any explanatory text, rationale, or meta-commentary about the edits made. Just return the clean, edited chapter text.
```

#### 2. Cleaned Existing Chapter Files ✅
**Files Cleaned**:
- `books/book_book_about_broken_love/ch01_chapter_1_understan.md`
- `books/book_book_about_broken_love/ch02_chapter_2_understan.md`
- `books/book_book_about_dark_scifi_romance/ch01_chapter_1_understan.md`
- `books/book_book_about_dark_scifi_romance/ch02_chapter_2_understan.md`

#### 3. Created Cleanup Tools ✅
**Scripts Created**:
- `clean_chapters.py`: Automated cleanup of existing chapter files
- `test_editor_fix.py`: Test script to verify the fix works correctly

### Verification Results

#### ✅ Test Results
- **Editor Agent Test**: PASSED - Returns only clean content
- **Content Length**: Appropriate (156 characters for test content)
- **No Unwanted Patterns**: Confirmed no meta-commentary included
- **Quality**: Proper grammar and clarity improvements maintained

#### ✅ Cleaned Files
